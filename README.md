# MSFS Sim Rate Monitor

As we all know, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 still doesn’t give us any proper way to know what the **current sim rate** is.  
A lot of people use sim rate to speed up cruise, but the game only gives you accelerate/decelerate — no actual display.  

Sure, you *can* check the flight plan timer in-game… but that’s not really a nice way.  
This little tool simply **shows the current sim rate**, so you can have a smoother experience.


## QuickStart
1. Download from release  
2. Run it after or before MSFS, doesn’t matter
